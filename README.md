CFPAYMENT
=========

⚠️  After 16 years, our team is moving on to [stripe-cfml](https://github.com/jcberquist/stripe-cfml) and I am retiring CFPAYMENT.  

Overview
==================

ColdFusion payment processing library makes plumbing e-commerce apps easy.  

Rather than roll your own credit card, ACH or alternative payment gateway with error, currency and money handling, leverage one of our production-tested gateways or extend our base gateway and write only the code necessary to create requests and parse responses for your gateway. Eliminates writing boilerplate code and handling esoteric CFHTTP errors that only seem to happen in production.

Tens of millions of dollars have been processed successfully.  Inspired by Ruby's ActiveMerchant.

Compatibility Note
==================

Effort has been made to keep cfpayment compatible with ACF at least as far back as CF8.  However, with the widespread elimination of SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 in response to security issues and the introduction of SAN/SNI and SHA-256 certificates, versions of (Adobe) ColdFusion as recent as 10 are becoming increasingly unable to make secure CFHTTP calls to remote gateways.  As of 5/26/15, Authorize.net uses SHA-256 certificates which Java 1.6 (part of CF7/CF8) does not support.  Other gateways such as Paypal are making similar upgrades and more are expected to follow.

If you are using an older version, you should consider upgrading, trying another engine such as Railo/Lucee, or using a the customer tag CFX_HTTP5 if you are on Windows.

Install
=======

A "/cfpayment" mapping is required to the cfpayment root folder.  Either add it via the Admin or on CF8+, create a [per-application mapping](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/Developing/WSc3ff6d0ea77859461172e0811cbec0b63c-7fd5.html#WS0C5B9A8B-32B5-4db2-BC04-B76DF8823A34) in the Application.cfc:

```cfml
this.mappings["/cfpayment"] = "/path/to/your/cfpayment/folder";
```

Charge an Account in 6 Lines of Code
====================================
```js
// initialize gateway
cfg = { path = "gateway.stripe.stripe", TestSecretKey = "tGN0bIwXnHdwOa85VABjPdSn8nWY7G7I" };
svc = createObject("component", "cfpayment.api.core").init(cfg);
gw = svc.getGateway();


// create the account
account = svc.createCreditCard().setAccount(4242424242424242).setMonth(10).setYear(year(now())+1)
             .setFirstName("John").setLastName("Doe");

// in cents = $50.00, defaults to USD but can take any ISO currency code
money = svc.createMoney(5000); 

// charge the card
response = gw.purchase(money = money, account = account);

// did we succeed?
if (response.getSuccess()) {
  // yay!  look at response.getResult() or response.getParsedResult()
  // verify response.isValidAVS() or response.isValidCVV()
} else {
  // check response.getStatus(), output response.getMessage()
}
```
