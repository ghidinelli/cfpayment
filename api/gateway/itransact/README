 * "Back-end" XML - receive customer details and post them to iTransact.com using alternative XML
                    interface - does NOT provide customer email receipts, etc.  The private-labeled
                    solution that requires more integration but more flexibility.
 
This Gateway implementation is for the third gateway, the "Back-end XML Gateway".  For serious 
e-commerce merchants, this gives you absolute control over all aspects of the payment processing
workflow but also requires more integration.  Or, it did until we wrote the gateway for you.

Now you simply need to worry about the order tracking and reporting on your end, which any serious
e-commerce shop is already doing.  Even simple e-commerce companies will have a few database tables
for orders, customers and so forth.

I've been using this gateway for the last 5 years (and 4 years at a company before that) and it has
served me well.  

To obtain service documentation (if desired) or your own test account (recommended), contact iTransact
